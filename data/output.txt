My calculation has only taken into account the periods of your policy where an
Unfair Relationship existed. However, I've calculated compensatory interest for the
full life of your policy.

We've applied additional interest to compensate you for the loss of use of the
money you used to pay for PPI. The statutory rate of compensatory interest is
currently 8%. We'll take into account the fact that the statutory rate was 15% before
1 April 1993, if applicable.

Please note that as the above interest is compensation interest we're obliged to
deduct income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). The gross interest will count
towards your personal savings allowance. If we have deducted more tax than you
have to pay you may be able to reclaim all or some of the tax deducted from HM
Revenue and Customs (HMRC). If you pay tax at rates higher than the basic rate it
is your responsibility to disclose and pay any additional tax due directly to HMRC.

You should retain this letter as evidence of the tax deduction, as this interest and
tax will not be included in any certificate of interest you may receive in respect of
any other savings you may hold with us/the bank. Please note this gross interest
counts towards any Personal Savings Allowance. Please refer to the PP] Advice
section of the HMRC website for more information, or call HMRC Tax Helpline:

Appendix A — Details of My Decision

Not Reviewed due to Time Limits / Unfair Relationship Created — Loan:
100087240691

As you raised your complaint more than three years after we wrote to you to explain
common failings in PPi sales, I'm unable to review your PPI mis-selling concerns.

I've concluded, based on the information available to me, that the undisclosed commission
and profit share created an Unfair Relationship.

When we sold PPI, we did not inform you that we would receive a commission and a share
of any related profits from the insurance company. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
has determined that the non-disclosure of commission and profit share of more than 50%
of a customer's PP! premium is likely to create an Unfair Relationship. The total
undisclosed commission and profit share in your sale was more than 50%.

I've calculated the redress for this decision based on the undisclosed commission and

profit share you paid on the premium above 50%. I've outlined the commission and profit
share level/s I’ve used to calculate my offer in Appendix B.

Information and Documentation Used during My Review
¢ Internal records

Additional Regulatory Information

On 14 January 2005, general insurance including PPI became regulated by the Financial
Services Authority (FSA). On 14 April 2013, the FSA was replaced by two new regulatory
bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA). The FCA is now responsible for regulation of conduct in retail, as well as wholesale,
financial markets and the infrastructure that supports those markets.

Unfair Relationship Assessment:

You have the right to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, free
of charge — but you must do so within six months of the date of this letter.

If you do not refer your complaint in time, the Ombudsman will not have our permission to

example, if the Ombudsman believes that the delay was as a result of exceptional
circumstances.

PPI Mis-Selling Assessment (Time Limit):

You have the right to refer your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, free
of charge.

The Ombudsman might not be able to consider your complaint if:

* what you're complaining about happened more than six years ago, and
* you're complaining more than three years after you realised (or should have
realised) that there was a problem.

We think that your complaint was made outside of these time limits but this is a matter for
the Ombudsman to decide. if the Ombudsman agrees with us, they will not have our
permission to consider your complaint and so will only be able to do so in very limited
circumstances.

If you do decide to refer your complaint to the Ombudsman you must do so within
six months of the date of this letter.

If you do not refer your complaint to the Ombudsman within six months of the date of this

you of the existence or size of this commission.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued new rules and guidance which require
lenders that supplied PPI to consider whether the non-disclosure of anticipated
commission and any future profit share by the underwriter at the time of the sale led to an
Unfair Relationship under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.

In relation to loan ending 0691, the FCA's rules governing this type of complaint confirm
that only a PPI policy that protects a credit agreement which falls within a specific date
range and which is subject to the Consumer Credit Act should be assessed to determine
whether an Unfair Relationship existed.

The applicable dates, specified by the Consumer Credit Act, are loans sold in the following
timeframe:

*on or after 6 April 2007; or

* before 6 April 2007, if the loan, or a later loan linked to it, is still open on 6 April 2008.
Where a loan falls outside the relevant dates, it may still be considered as part of an Unfair
Relationship assessment if it is linked to a loan which falls within the relevant dates.

In the table below I've outlined the start and end dates of your loan and whether it falls
within the scope of an Unfair Relationship assessment.

Loan within the scope of an
Start Date End Date Unfair Relationship

assessment?
13 January 2008 31 January 2015

Your loan falls within the scope of an Unfair Relationship assessment. | accept that we did
not disclose the existence or size of the commission and profit share payable on your PPI
premiums before the sale was concluded. The FCA has determined that the non-disclosure
of anticipated commission and profit share of more than 50% of a customer's PPI premium
at the time of sale is likely to create an Unfair Relationship. Based on the information
available to me, the anticipated commission and profit share in your sale was more than
50%.

l've concluded that the undisclosed commission and profit share created an Unfair
Relationship during the sale of your PPI policy.

Dear Mr Compson

Thank you for getting in touch with us about your Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)
policy.

My Decision

I'm unable to review your PPI mis-selling complaint in relation to loan 100087240691 as
we received it outside the time limit for the submission of a complaint set by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA).

When we sold PPI, we did not inform you that we would receive a commission and a share
of any related profits from the insurance company. For loan 100087240691, I've therefore
assessed whether the non-disclosure of the level of commission and profit share payable
from the PPI premium created an Unfair Relationship.

lve concluded that the available information indicates that an Unfair Relationship was
created during the sale of your PPI policy protecting loan 100087240691.

Time Limit

We wrote to you about your PPI policy protecting foan 100087240691 on 13 January 2014.
We explained that we had reviewed our PPI sales process and found that your PPI policy
may have been mis-sold. We outlined common failings in PPI sales and invited you to
respond to us promptly if any of these concerns applied to you.

Where the PPI policy was sold more than six years ago, the FCA’s complaint handling
rules set a time limit of three years from the date that a consumer became aware that they
had cause to complain.

Your PPI sale occurred more than six years ago. We received your complaint on 11
February 2019. This is more than three years after our letter dated 13 January 2014. So,
for loan 100087240691, |’m unable to review your PPI mis-selling concerns.

Period ~~ Level of commission

My calculation has only taken into account the periods of your policy where an
Unfair Relationship existed. However, I've calculated compensatory interest for the
full life of your policy.

We've applied additional interest to compensate you for the loss of use of the
money you used to pay for PPI. The statutory rate of compensatory interest is
currently 8%. We'll take into account the fact that the statutory rate was 15% before
1 April 1993, if applicable.

Please note that as the above interest is compensation interest we're obliged to
deduct income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%). The gross interest will count
towards your personal savings allowance. If we have deducted more tax than you
have to pay you may be able to reclaim all or some of the tax deducted from HM
Revenue and Customs (HMRC). If you pay tax at rates higher than the basic rate it
is your responsibility to disclose and pay any additional tax due directly to HMRC.

You should retain this letter as evidence of the tax deduction, as this interest and
tax will not be included in any certificate of interest you may receive in respect of
any other savings you may hold with us/the bank. Please note this gross interest
counts towards any Personal Savings Allowance. Please refer to the PP] Advice
section of the HMRC website for more information, or call HMRC Tax Helpline:

Appendix A — Details of My Decision

Not Reviewed due to Time Limits / Unfair Relationship Created — Loan:
100087240691

As you raised your complaint more than three years after we wrote to you to explain
common failings in PPi sales, I'm unable to review your PPI mis-selling concerns.

I've concluded, based on the information available to me, that the undisclosed commission
and profit share created an Unfair Relationship.

When we sold PPI, we did not inform you that we would receive a commission and a share
of any related profits from the insurance company. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)
has determined that the non-disclosure of commission and profit share of more than 50%
of a customer's PP! premium is likely to create an Unfair Relationship. The total
undisclosed commission and profit share in your sale was more than 50%.

I've calculated the redress for this decision based on the undisclosed commission and

profit share you paid on the premium above 50%. I've outlined the commission and profit
share level/s I’ve used to calculate my offer in Appendix B.

Additional Regulatory Information

On 14 January 2005, general insurance including PPI became regulated by the Financial
Services Authority (FSA). On 14 April 2013, the FSA was replaced by two new regulatory
bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority
(PRA). The FCA is now responsible for regulation of conduct in retail, as well as wholesale,
financial markets and the infrastructure that supports those markets.

you of the existence or size of this commission.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has issued new rules and guidance which require
lenders that supplied PPI to consider whether the non-disclosure of anticipated
commission and any future profit share by the underwriter at the time of the sale led to an
Unfair Relationship under section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act.

In relation to loan ending 0691, the FCA's rules governing this type of complaint confirm
that only a PPI policy that protects a credit agreement which falls within a specific date
range and which is subject to the Consumer Credit Act should be assessed to determine
whether an Unfair Relationship existed.

The applicable dates, specified by the Consumer Credit Act, are loans sold in the following
timeframe:

*on or after 6 April 2007; or

* before 6 April 2007, if the loan, or a later loan linked to it, is still open on 6 April 2008.
Where a loan falls outside the relevant dates, it may still be considered as part of an Unfair
Relationship assessment if it is linked to a loan which falls within the relevant dates.

In the table below I've outlined the start and end dates of your loan and whether it falls
within the scope of an Unfair Relationship assessment.

Loan within the scope of an
Start Date End Date Unfair Relationship

assessment?
13 January 2008 31 January 2015

Your loan falls within the scope of an Unfair Relationship assessment. | accept that we did
not disclose the existence or size of the commission and profit share payable on your PPI
premiums before the sale was concluded. The FCA has determined that the non-disclosure
of anticipated commission and profit share of more than 50% of a customer's PPI premium
at the time of sale is likely to create an Unfair Relationship. Based on the information
available to me, the anticipated commission and profit share in your sale was more than
50%.

l've concluded that the undisclosed commission and profit share created an Unfair
Relationship during the sale of your PPI policy.

Dear Mr Compson

Thank you for getting in touch with us about your Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)
policy.

My Decision

I'm unable to review your PPI mis-selling complaint in relation to loan 100087240691 as
we received it outside the time limit for the submission of a complaint set by the Financial
Conduct Authority (FCA).

When we sold PPI, we did not inform you that we would receive a commission and a share
of any related profits from the insurance company. For loan 100087240691, I've therefore
assessed whether the non-disclosure of the level of commission and profit share payable
from the PPI premium created an Unfair Relationship.

lve concluded that the available information indicates that an Unfair Relationship was
created during the sale of your PPI policy protecting loan 100087240691.

Time Limit

We wrote to you about your PPI policy protecting foan 100087240691 on 13 January 2014.
We explained that we had reviewed our PPI sales process and found that your PPI policy
may have been mis-sold. We outlined common failings in PPI sales and invited you to
respond to us promptly if any of these concerns applied to you.

Where the PPI policy was sold more than six years ago, the FCA’s complaint handling
rules set a time limit of three years from the date that a consumer became aware that they
had cause to complain.

Your PPI sale occurred more than six years ago. We received your complaint on 11
February 2019. This is more than three years after our letter dated 13 January 2014. So,
for loan 100087240691, |’m unable to review your PPI mis-selling concerns.
